The methodology of “Learning By Doing” is a unique one adopted by MSIT. It aims at giving hands - on experience which helps the students understand the practical implementation aspects and the concepts associated with it.

MSIT’s “Learning by Doing” method involves learning in a project-centric way. This helps students to solve problems by applying concepts. Each course is broken into manageable modules each of which is offered as a project to be worked on. Students work in teams with a corporate-like environment. The students understand the concept while working on the project and submit the relevant tasks (deliverables) within the deadline specified by their mentors. The students get the required guidance and support at every level from the mentors who have a wide knowledge base which enhances the knowledge of the students. Each course is offered by a principal mentor and the student: mentor ratio at MSIT stands out to be 10:1 giving enough scope for the students to interact with their mentor whenever required. Personalized mentoring at MSIT aims at nurturing the students in every way. Students are given individual workstations with laptops and 24x7 internet facilities. Rich digital content with strong audio-visual support alongside constant mentoring provides them with the necessary platform, with lectures by eminent people also. Therefore, MSIT students gain hands-on experience from innovative learning solutions.

        <img src="at_a_glance1.png" width=100%>
        <p>International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH) is an autonomous university, founded as a not-for-profit public private partnership (N-PPP) in 1998, and is the first IIIT in India under this model. Over the years, the institute has evolved strong research programmes in various areas, with an emphasis on technology and applied research for industry and society. The institute facilitates interdisciplinary research and a seamless flow of knowledge. Several world-renowned centres of excellence are part of IIITHâ€™s research portfolio. It has established various joint collaboration and co-innovation models with an industry outreach spanning significant national and multinational companies. Its innovative curriculum allows students the flexibility of selecting their courses and projects. Apart from academics the institute provides students with a comprehensive environment that promotes art and culture, sports, societal contributions and self-governance. Even undergraduate students get to participate in ongoing research and technology development - an opportunity unprecedented in India. As a result, a vibrant undergraduate programme co-exists along with a strong postgraduate programme.</p>

        <img src="campus2.png" width=30%>
        <p>Our 66 acres campus, located on the main Gachibowli road (also called the Old Bombay highway) is well connected by bus and is on the route for the proposed metro rail. We are surrounded by many academic and research institutions like the Hyderabad Central University, Indian School of Business (ISB), TCS-CMC, Indian Immunologicals and Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Development Banking (JNIDB), and are minutes away from the bustling HiTech City Center and Lingampally, which are major shopping areas. Lingampally is also the nearest railway station.
            Within-campus facilities include a bank extension counter, ATM machine, stationary shop, and laundry services. The campus has been developed quite a bit since the institute was started in 1998. </p>

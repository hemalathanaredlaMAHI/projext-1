            <li>B.tech Program</li>

            <p>The B.Tech. programme aims to provide core concepts and skills in the broad areas of engineering, sciences, mathematics and humanities, supported by practicums. The practicums are intended to give students a first-hand understanding of leveraging their initial breadth (and skills) in programme and applying it to develop solutions for real-life problems. Students also learn next level concepts and do course projects by enrolling in advanced courses for two years, and to pursue a chosen specialization, or to broaden knowledge and in their programme of study.

                A unique feature of IIIT-H's B.Tech. programme is the strong encouragement and abundance of opportunities it provides students to do research. As a result a large number undergraduate students have published in prestigious journals, and top national and international conferences. B.Tech. is offered in the following areas:
                <br>
                i. B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)<br>
                ii.B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)</p>
            <li>M.tech</li>
            <p>The aim of M.Tech. programme, is to help graduates and working professionals enhance their professional qualifications and career prospects. This programme imparts solid foundation followed by advanced knowledge in one or more specialized areas. M.Tech. is offered in the following areas:
                <br>
                i. Computer Science and Engineering.<br>
                ii.Computer Science and Information Security.<br>
                iii.VLSI and Computer Engineering -This programme is currently not being offered.<br>
                iv.Computer Aided Structural Engineering.<br>
                v.Bioinformatics - Admissions are suspended from 2020.<br>
                vi.Computational Linguistics -This programme is currently not being offered.</p>
            <li>MSIT</li>
